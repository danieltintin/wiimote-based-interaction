This application was used as a testing environment for Wiimote-based 3d interaction. It consists of a three-dimensional space with cubes that can be moved and rotated. In order to maintain a neutral data domain and take advantage of the third dimension, our implemented objects are cubes. On each of their faces distinct textures are placed. Thus, an obvious reason for object manipulation (i.e. rotation) was provided.<br>
<br>
The application was entirely built in Java 1.5 & Processing 1.0. The main reason<br>
for using Processing was the lightweight graphics pipeline, which enabled us to<br>
make a both appealing and powerful visualization.<br>
